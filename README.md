(Original readme for the template repository [here](https://github.com/mattvenn/wokwi-verilog-gds-test/blob/main/README.md))

This repo is an experiment in using Verilog source files instead of Wokwi diagrams for [TinyTapeout](https://tinytapeout.com), it solves the classic problem of diving a clock by 3, with a 50% duty cycle, using no sequential cells.  It's more or less an answer to execise 26.7 in [Digital Design](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/engineering/circuits-and-systems/digital-design-systems-approach?format=HB&isbn=9780521199506) by Dally.

The verilog code is in src/user_module_340067262721426004.v
